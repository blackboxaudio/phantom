Phantom is a phase distortion synthesizer plugin targeting VST3 and AU for MacOS and Windows platforms. It uses the unique method of *phase distortion synthesis* to create sound and is capable of some truly bizarre sound design, which is really what makes it fun to use. Checkout a [sample](https://soundcloud.com/apellum/sample-phantom-phase-distortion-synthesizer)!

## Dependencies

- JUCE (v6.0.8)
- VST3 SDK (v3.6.14)

## Usage

Phantom is capable of running with any plugin host as long as it supports VST3 or AU. Please refer to your DAW's manual to see compatible plugin formats. For more information about installating or using the plugin, please refer to the [installation guide](./info/INSTALLATION.md) or [manual](./info/MANUAL.md) respectively.
